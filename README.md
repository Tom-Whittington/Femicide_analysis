# Project summary

The basic idea is to repeat the analysis in the attached paper using this updated and expanded version of the UNODC dataset (1990-2020) rather than the old one we used in the paper (2003-2014 only). The question: is there an association between adopting anti-femicide actions in or before 2012 (see AFAX list in the paper) and subsequent femicide rates (2012-2020). This prospective approach is much better than the retrospective design in the paper. The unit of analysis is country (n=133).


Just like before we would have to merge this new UNODC dataset with our existing anti-femicide dataset to do the analysis. But unlike before, this new dataset has rates per 100,000 so we donâ€™t need to calculate these specially.
